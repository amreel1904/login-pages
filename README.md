Login also called “logon” or “sign in” is a term in computer terms, which is in the form of an entry process for users to access a computer system. Login aims to manage the identification process. The minimum login process consists of a username and password. To get access rights, the username and password cannot be typed wrong, because the two are interrelated and cannot be separated.

An attractive login form is one of the most important things in making a website because it will determine the user experience when accessing our website. Therefore this time we will create a login form with a simple floating label animation using only HTML and CSS.
